# TravelingSalesman-Genetic
My first genetic algorithm I developed.
I came up with the idea while studying natural selection.
I quickly learnt python and implemented it (hence the mess), and to my surprise it worked.
Since then I have created/implemented new method inspired by my biological studies.
